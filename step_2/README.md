Use superagent to make a search request to IMDb, then use cheerio to parse the response and find the URL to the movies page.

If IMDb had an "I'm Feeling Lucky" type search like google this wouldn't be necessary, but each search yields multiple results.  Luckily the first one on the list is always the one youre looking for.

To run this script first copy a movie title from the result of step 1 and paste it in on line 15 of step_2.js, then `cd` into the directory and run `node step_2.js`
